                        For the past two years I have been working as a technical contractor for Barclays Bank, where I developed ways to monitor
                        and visualise application server health. Initially using <strong>PHP</strong>                        and then moving onto <strong>Angular.js</strong>, I found the most satifying aspect of my job was
                        creating websites which succinctly display data to techincally unsavvy audiences.
                    </p>
                    <p class='text'>
                        <strong>Automation</strong> was another aspect of my role, whereby I would implement deployment pipelines
                        for the projects, using tools such as <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong>Nolio</strong>. This not
                        only lessens the time between a change being published into various environments, but allows it to
                        be fully tested along the way.

                        I am currently based in Knutsford, Cheshire, but I worked at Barclays' corporate headquarters in London previously.

                        I studied BSc Physics with Computing at the University of Bath, where my disertation was focused on the simulation of funky
                        atom formations called Kagome lattices in crystalline glass.

                        In my free time I mostly play video and board games, with my favourites being DotA 2 and 7 Wonders Duel respectively. I like
                        to attend conventions, my favourite being BayCon in Exeter, which is a 5 day marathon of playing
                        new and old board games. I am a keen gardener, I like to read fantasy novels and now this portfolio
                        is starting to look like rubbish a dating profile.
