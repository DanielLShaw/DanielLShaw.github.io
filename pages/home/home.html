                    For the past two years I have been working as a technical contractor for Barclays Bank, where I developed ways to monitor
                    and visualise application server health. Initially using <strong>PHP</strong> and
                    then moving onto <strong>Angular.js</strong>, I found the most satifying aspect of my job was creating
                    websites which succinctly display data to techincally unsavvy audiences.

                    <strong>Automation</strong> was another aspect of my role, whereby I would implement deployment pipelines
                    for the projects, using tools such as <strong>Jenkins</strong> and <strong>Nolio</strong>. This not only
                    lessens the time between a change being published into various environments, but allows it to be fully
                    tested along the way.

                    I am currently based in Knutsford, Cheshire, but I worked at Barclays' corporate headquarters in London previously.

                    I studied BSc Physics with Computing at the University of Bath, where my disertation was focused on the simulation of funky
                    atom formations called Kagome lattices in crystalline glass.

                    In my free time I mostly play video and board games, with my favourites being DotA 2 and 7 Wonders Duel respectively. I like
                    to attend conventions, my favourite being BayCon in Exeter, which is a 5 day marathon of playing new
                    and old board games. I am a keen gardener, I like to read fantasy novels and now this portfolio is starting
                    to look like rubbish a dating profile.
